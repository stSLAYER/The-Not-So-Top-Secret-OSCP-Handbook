# The-Not-So-Top-Secret-OSCP-Handbook
<h3>So...what's in the box?</h3>
Inside this repository is my OSCP handbook, it's kind of like a cheatsheet in a way...but different. During my time studying through labs such as HackTheBox, VirtualHackingLabs, PWK, PG Proving grounds, etc (The list goes on), I learned some really interesting techniques and came across the same problems over and over again, so I got tired of constantly Googling the solution, so instead I created a CherryTree document that contains a lot of the stuff I learned from all those labs and summarized it but in a more managable and less overwhelming format.

<h3>How can this OSCP-Handbook help you?</h3>
To keep it simple, this handbook contains useful syntax for certain tools (Like GoBuster and Wfuzz), it has solutions for certain problems one might encounter while pentesting against a vulnerable machine, it contains a plethora of useful shells that can be used in different situations, overall it's really just there for convenience sake and to serve as a reminder when you forget the basics...or if you're too lazy to Google a solution.

<h3>When have I used this Handbook?</h3>
Long story short, this is a Handbook i created when i first started studying for my OSCP, I got tired of trying to memorize the syntax for certain tools and having to dig through my search history to try and find a certain shell/command i used, so I compiled everything into one cute little CherryTree document, it has Bold headings so I can easily find what I'm looking for and a colorful description to go with it, that being said, I've been using this Handbook since I began my OSCP journey, I just recently passed my OSCP and decided to complete the Handbook as best as I can so i can share it with others to use, and yes, it served me well during my exam, anytime i got stuck or needed a reminder on how do enumerate a certain service, the Handbook would be my go-to when I got stuck

<h3>test

This is my personal cheery tree I created that helped me with both my OSCP and pre-OSCP study time, it was made for the sake of convenience and has syntax and solutions for certain encounters. 
I hope it can help individuals in some way or another, It's pretty much a cheat-sheet, but a bit smaller, ideally you'd want to keep it open in a second window and refer to it when you get stuck on something. 
It should be noted that it DOES NOT contain everything you need, I encourage anyone to add their own notes to it, it's just there for convenience with syntax and other things that you might need help with.
