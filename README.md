# The-Not-So-Top-Secret-OSCP-Handbook
<h3>So...what's in the box?</h3>
Inside this repository is my OSCP handbook, it's kind of like a cheatsheet in a way...but different. During my time studying through labs such as HackTheBox, VirtualHackingLabs, PWK, PG Proving grounds, etc (The list goes on), I learned some really interesting techniques and came across the same problems over and over again, so I got tired of constantly Googling the same solution, so instead I created a CherryTree document that contains a lot of the stuff I learned from all those labs and summarized it into a more managable and less overwhelming format.

<h3>How can this OSCP-Handbook help you?</h3>
To keep it simple, this handbook contains useful syntax for certain tools (Like GoBuster and Wfuzz), it has solutions for certain problems one might encounter while pentesting against a vulnerable machine, it contains a plethora of useful shells that can be used in different situations, overall it's really just there for convenience sake and to serve as a reminder when you forget the basics...or if you're too lazy to Google a solution. So if you find yourself constantly Googling the syntax of a tool or cycling through different payloads not knowing which one to choose and overall just get a bit overwhelmed with information and need a little guide to point you in the right direction now and again, I think this Handbook is for you.

<h3>When have I used this Handbook?</h3>
Long story short, I created this is Handbook when i first started studying for my OSCP, I got tired of trying to memorize the syntax for certain tools and having to dig through my search history to try and find a certain shell/command I used, so I compiled everything into one cute little CherryTree document, it has Bold headings so I can easily find what I'm looking for and a colorful description to go with it, that being said, I've been using this Handbook since I began my OSCP journey, I just recently passed my OSCP and decided to complete the Handbook as best as I can so i can share it with others to use and yes, it served me well during my exam, anytime I got stuck or needed a reminder on how do enumerate a certain service, the Handbook was there to help me. 

<h3>Do I plan to add more to this Handbook?</h3>
Oh Absolutely! at the very moment, I have added everything I could think of based on all my notes, howvever I still wouldn't call this Handbook "complete", I purposely left out just a bit of information, not because I'm lazy but because it's how I intended it to be, I want others to use this Handbook almost as a template so that whatever I missed out on, they will feel obligated to add to it and aside from that, I want to keep it simple, it has what i think you'll need when taking on this OSCP journey.
