# The-Not-So-Top-Secret-OSCP-Handbook
<h1>**So...what's in the box?**</h1>
Inside this repository is my OSCP handbook, it's kind of like a cheatsheet in a way...but different. During my time studying through labs such as HackTheBox, VirtualHackingLabs, PWK, PG Proving grounds, etc (The list goes on), I learned some really interesting techniques and came across the same problems over and over again, so I got tired of constantly Googling the solution, so instead I created a CherryTree document that contains a lot of the stuff I learned from all those labs and summarized it but in a more managable and less overwhelming format.

This is my personal cheery tree I created that helped me with both my OSCP and pre-OSCP study time, it was made for the sake of convenience and has syntax and solutions for certain encounters. 
I hope it can help individuals in some way or another, It's pretty much a cheat-sheet, but a bit smaller, ideally you'd want to keep it open in a second window and refer to it when you get stuck on something. 
It should be noted that it DOES NOT contain everything you need, I encourage anyone to add their own notes to it, it's just there for convenience with syntax and other things that you might need help with.
