# The-Not-So-Top-Secret-OSCP-Handbook
This is my personal cheery tree I created that helped me with both my OSCP and pre-OSCP study time, it was made for the sake of convenience and has syntax and solutions for certain encounters. 
I hope it can help individuals in some way or another, It's pretty much a cheat-sheet, but a bit smaller, ideally you'd want to keep it open in a second window and refer to it when you get stuck on something. 
It should be noted that it DOES NOT contain everything you need, I encourage anyone to add their own notes to it, it's just there for convenience with syntax and other things that you might need help with.
